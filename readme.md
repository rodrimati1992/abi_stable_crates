[Documentation. This goes to 0.7 because that has working docs)](https://docs.rs/abi_stable/0.7)

For Rust-to-Rust ffi,
with a focus on creating libraries loaded at program startup,
and with load-time type-checking.

This library allows defining Rust libraries that can be loaded at runtime,
even if they were built with a different Rust version than the crate that depends on it.

These are some usecases for this library:
    
- Converting a Rust dependency tree from compiling statically into a single binary,
    into one binary (and potentially) many dynamic libraries,
    allowing separate re-compilation on changes.

- Creating a plugin system (without support for unloading).
    
# Features

Currently this library has these features:

- Features the `#[sabi_trait]` attribute,for creating ffi-safe trait objects.

- ffi-safe equivalent of trait objects for any combination of a selection of traits.

- Provides ffi-safe alternatives/wrappers for many standard library types,
    in the `std_types` module.

- Provides ffi-safe wrappers for some crates,in the `external_types` module.

- Provides the `StableAbi` trait for asserting that types are ffi-safe.

- Features for building extensible modules and vtables,without breaking ABI compatibility.

- Supports ffi-safe nonexhaustive enums,wrapped in `NonExhaustive<>`.

- Checking at load-time that the types in the dynamic library have the expected layout,
    allowing for semver compatible changes while checking the layout of types.

- Provides the `StableAbi` derive macro to both assert that the type is ffi compatible,
    and to get the layout of the type at load-time to check that it is still compatible.

# Changelog

The changelog is in the "Changelog.md" file.

# Example crates

For **example crates** using `abi_stable` you can look at the 
crates in the examples directory ,in the repository for this crate.

To run the examples generally you'll have to build the `*_impl` crate,
then run the `*_user` crate (all `*_user` crates should have a help message).

These are the example crates:

- 0 - modules and interface types:
    Demonstrates abi_stable "modules"(structs of function pointers),
    and interface types through a command line application with a dynamically linked backend.

- 1 - trait objects:
    Demonstrates ffi-safe trait objects (Generated using `#[sabi_trait]`)
    by creating a minimal plugin system.

- 2 - nonexhaustive-enums:
    Demonstrates nonexhaustive-enums as parameters and return values,
    for an application that manages the catalogue of a shop.

# Example

This is a full example,demonstrating:

- `user crates`(defined in the Architecture section bellow).

- `#[sabi_trait]` generated ffi-safe trait objects.

- `DynTrait<_>`:
    An ffi-safe multi-trait object for a selection of trait,
    which can also be unerased back into the concrete type.

- `interface crates`(defined in the Architecture section bellow).

- `Ã¬mplementation crates`(defined in the Architecture section bellow).

Note that each section represents its own crate ,
with comments for how to turn them into 3 separate crates.

# Safety

This library ensures that the loaded libraries are safe to use through these mechanisms:

- The abi_stable ABI of the library is checked,
    Each `0.y.0` version and `x.0.0` version of abi_stable defines its own ABI 
    which is incompatible with previous versions.

- Types are recursively checked when the dynamic library is loaded,
    before any function can be called.

Note that this library assumes that dynamic libraries come from a benign source,
these checks are done purely to detect programming errors.

# Planned features

### Eventually

WASM support,with the same features as native dynamic libraries,
once WASM supports dynamic linking.

# Not-currently-planned features

Supporting library unloading,
since this requires building the entire library with the assumption that anything 
might get unloaded at any time.

# Architecture


This is a way that users can structure their libraries to allow for dynamic linking.

For how to evolve dynamically loaded libraries loaded using the safe API in abi_stable 
[look here](https://docs.rs/abi_stable/*/abi_stable/docs/library_evolution/index.html).

### Interface crate

A crate which declares:

- The root module (a structs of function pointers/other modules),
    which implements the `RootModule` trait,
    exported from the dynamic library.

- All the sub-modules of the root module.

- All the public types passed to and returned by the functions.

- Optionally:
    declare the ffi-safe traits with `#[sabi_trait]`,
    used as trait objects in the public interface.

- Optionally:
    declares Ã¬nterface types,types which implement InterfaceType,
    used to specify the traits usable in the DynTrait ffi-safe trait object .


### Implementation crate

The crate compiled as a dynamic library that:

- Implements all the functions declared in the `interface crate`.

- Declares a function to export the root module,
    using the `export_root_module` attribute to export the module.

- Optionally:
    Implement traits that were annotated with `#[sabi_trait]`,
    constructing their trait objects exposed in the public API.

- Optionally:create types which implement `ImplType<Iterface= Interface >`,
    where `Interface` is some interface type from the interface crate,
    so as to be able to use wrap it in `DynTrait`s of that interface.

### User crate

A crate that that declares the `Ã¬nterface crate` as a dependency,
and loads the pre-compiled `implementation crate` dynamic library from some path.

# Minimum Rust version

This crate support Rust back to 1.34
(previously 1.33,but had to abandon it because of an impossible to 
avoid internal compiler error related to associated types as types of associated constants),
using a build script to automatically enable features from newer versions.

# Cargo Features

If it becomes possible to disable build scripts,
you can manually enable support for Rust past 1.34 features with the `rust_*_*` cargo features.

These are default cargo features that enable optional crates :

- "channels":
    Depends on `crossbeam-channel`,
    wrapping channels from it for ffi in abi_stable::external_types::crossbeam_channel .

- "serde_json":
    Depends on `serde_json`,
    providing ffi-safe equivalents of 
    `&serde_json::value::RawValue` and `Box<serde_json::value::RawValue>`.


To disable the default features use:
```
[dependencies.abi_stable]
version="<current_version>"
default-features=false
features=[  ]
```
enabling the features you need in the `features` array.


### Manually enabled

These are features to manually enabled support for newer language features,
required until this library is updated to automatically detect them,
every one of which has a `nightly_*` equivalent.

Features:

- `const_params`:Enables items in abi_stable that use const generics.

### Nightly features

The `all_nightly` feature enables all the `nightly_*` equivalents of the 
manually enabled features.

Every `nightly_*` feature enables both support from abi_stable,
as well as the nightly feature flag in the compiler.

# Tools

Here are some tools,all of which are in the "tools" directory(folder).

A program to extract a variety of information from an abi_stable dynamic library.
